Leetcode Problem- https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-highest-and-lowest-of-k-scores/

Q.) You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.
    Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.
    Return the minimum possible difference.
  
Solution-
  
  public int minimumDifference(int[] nums, int k) {
        if(nums.length==1){
          return 0; 
       }
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int diff = 0;
        for(int e = k-1;e<nums.length;e++){
            diff = nums[e] - nums[e-(k-1)];
            min = Math.min(min,diff);
        }
        return min;
 }
